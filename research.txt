1. Digital cardiology. Cardiac MRI is widely recognized as the gold standard for cardiovascular diagnosis. However, its clinical potential is significantly limited by the lack of effective interpretation systems. Presently, CMR analysis is dominated by Circle CVI, a Canadian company. Unfortunately, the high cost of this software—ranging from tens of thousands of dollars annually for subscribing basic modules, such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurement, to hundreds of thousands for advanced functionalities like 4D-flow MRI—prevents widespread adoption. Consequently, many medical centers, equipped with advanced MRI machines, lack the necessary tools to analyze cardiac conditions.
My research focuses on developing AI systems that assist clinicians in automating cardiac function measurements, interpreting cardiac data, and providing evidence-based recommendations for managing cardiovascular diseases. This effort builds upon my research published in Nature Medicine (1) and my earlier work (8-10) in video content and semantic analysis, which incorporates both temporal motion and morphological features. I aim to open-source these platforms, similar to ChatGPT, to democratize access to advanced cardiac MRI interpretation tools, thereby enhancing CVD diagnosis and management, particularly in resource-limited settings.

2. AI-enabled precision oncology. The global lack of access to molecular diagnostics drives health disparities and impedes the exploration of novel subgroup-specific therapeutic opportunities. Building on my previous Cancer Cell (2) research, I aim to extend AI-powered, low-cost, presurgical molecular diagnostics to other brain tumors, beyond medulloblastoma, and eventually to pan-cancer applications.
Furthermore, I am eager to explore AI-driven presurgical prognostic prediction systems for cancer patients. At the core of this system is the integration of large language models (LLMs) for clinical report encoding, syndromic surveillance, and vision models for medical imaging analysis. This approach could potentially offer presurgical risk stratification even more powerful than molecular testing, revolutionizing cancer treatment management.

3. AI Algorithms driven by healthcare. As model sizes scale to billions of parameters, fine-tuning these large models for healthcare downstream tasks becomes increasingly impractical. My research aims to explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning that achieve high performance even with limited medical data. Work I have done in network-modulation (8) could offer a promising avenue for achieving an optimal balance between model accuracy and efficiency. I will continue exploring ways to leverage labeled and unlabeled data, data from related modalities and tasks, as well as low-quality annotations, to develop robust and generalizable systems for medical image reasoning. My ultimate goal is to overcome the resource constraints inherent in medical settings, ensuring that the AI models developed are both effective and generalizable across diverse healthcare scenarios.
My research will also focus on advancing multi-modality and multi-series inference, developing foundational AI models, and designing federated learning approaches to address privacy challenges in multi-center healthcare systems.
